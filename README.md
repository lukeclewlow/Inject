# Inject

##What is it? 
Re-writing the 'inject' method for Ruby using TDD.

##Objectives?
* Gain a deeper understanding of what the inject method does and how it achieves its purpose
* Keep practicing with Ruby and coding logic
* Use TDD to structure the challenge

###To run tests:
```
rspec
```

##Brief

* [The ruby-doc explanation of inject](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.1/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject)
* Make sure that my inject method can do all the things the original ruby one can, by running tests in parralel.

##Technologies
* Ruby
* RSpec
